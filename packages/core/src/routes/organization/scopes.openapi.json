Every organization scope is a part of the organization template.\n\nOrganization scopes will only be meaningful within an organization context. For example, a user may have a `read` scope for organization A, but not for organization B. To learn more about organization template and access control in organizations, see [this guide](/docs/rbac/organizations)."
